      PORT pin configuration for the SMIF/QSPI signals.
      We expect that the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes. These
      nodes will have a nodelabel that matches the Infineon SoC pinctrl
      defines and have the following format:
        p<port>_<pin>_smif<inst>_<signal>.

      Examples:
        pinctrl-0 = <&p23_0_smif0_data4 &p24_1_smif0_clk>;
    required: true

  pinctrl-names:
    description: Name of the pinctrl state used by the SMIF/QSPI controller.
