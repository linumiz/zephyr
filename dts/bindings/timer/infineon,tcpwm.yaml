properties:
  reg:
    type: array
    required: true
    description: Register base address and size information

  interrupts:
    type: array
    description: Interrupt mapping for TCPWM instance

  system-interrupts:
    type: array
    description: Required for cat1c devices

  pinctrl-0:
    description: |
      PORT pin configuration for SCL, SDA signals.
      We expect that the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes. These
      nodes will have a nodelabel that matches the Infineon SoC Pinctrl
      defines and have following
      format: p<port>_<pin>_<peripheral inst>_<signal>.

  divider-type:
    type: int
    description: |
      Specifies which type of divider to use.
      Defined by cy_en_divider_types_t in cy_sysclk.h.
    required: true

  divider-sel:
    type: int
    description: |
      Specifies which divider of the selected type to configure.
    required: true

  divider-val:
    type: int
    description: |
      Causes integer division of (divider value + 1), or division by 1 to 256
      (8-bit divider) or 1 to 65536 (16-bit divider).
    required: true

  ifx,peri-group:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Peripheral clock divider group. Use IFX_PERI_GRP_INST_SEL(grp, inst) macro.
      Required for cat1c devices

  resolution:
    type: int
    required: true
