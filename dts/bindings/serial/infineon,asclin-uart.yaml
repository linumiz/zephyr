  oversampling:
    type: int
    default: 16
    description: |
      Number of samples per bit. Valid range is 4-16.
      Higher values provide better noise immunity but limit maximum baud rate.

  samplepoint:
    type: int
    default: 8
    description: |
      Sample point position within the oversampling period.
      Should be between 1 and oversampling-1. Typically set to oversampling/2.

  median-filter:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable median filter for improved noise immunity.
      When enabled, uses 3-sample majority voting at the sample point.

  prescaler:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      Clock prescaler value. Valid range is 1-4096.
      Used to divide the input clock for baud rate generation.
