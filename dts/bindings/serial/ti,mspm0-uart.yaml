    required: true

    required: true

  dmas:
    description: |
      TX & RX dma specifiers used by async UART.

      The dmas are referenced in the UART node using the following syntax:
      dmas = <&dma_controller dma_channel dma_trigger_for_peripheral>
      dmas = <&dma 0 18)>, <&dma 1 17>;
      where the first entry is for the TX, and the second for RX.

  dma-names:
    description: |
      Required if the dmas property exists. Should be set to "tx" and "rx"
      to match the dmas property.

      For example
         dma-names = "tx", "rx";
